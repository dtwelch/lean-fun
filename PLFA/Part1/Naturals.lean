#doc (Manual) "Naturals" =>

Most are familiar with the natural numbers:
```
0
1
2
3
...
```
and so on. The set of natural numbers `ℕ` is inifite and we say that `0`, `1`,
`2`, `3`, and are *values* of type `ℕ` (otherwise indicated with: `0 : ℕ`,
`1 : ℕ`,  etc.).

Although there are infinitely many naturals, yet we can write down its
definition in just a few lines. Here it is as a pair of inference rules:
```
--------
zero : ℕ

m : ℕ
--------
suc m : ℕ
```
And here is the definition in Lean:

```lean
inductive ℕ : Type where
    | zero : ℕ
    | suc  : ℕ -> ℕ
```
Here `ℕ` is the name of the datatype we are defining, and `zero` and `suc`
(short for successor) are the *constructors* of the datatype.

Both definitions above tell us two things:

1. base case: `zero` is a natural number
2. inductive case: if `m` is a natural number, then `suc m` is also a natural
number.

Further, these two rules give the *only* ways of creating natural numbers.
Hence, the possible natural numbers are:
```
.zero
.suc .zero
.suc (.suc .zero)
...
```
We write `0` as the shorthand for the `zero` constructor and `1` as shorthand
for `suc zero`, the successor of zero, that is the number that comes after `0`.

# Exercise: `seven` (practice)

Write out `7` in longhand.

*potential sol:*
```lean
def seven : ℕ :=
  .suc $ .suc $ .suc $ .suc $ .suc $ .suc $ .suc .zero
```
# Unpacking the inference rules

Let's unpack the Lean definition. the keyword `inductive` tells us this is an
inductive definition, that is, we are defining a new datatype with constructors.
The phrase:
```
ℕ : Type
```
tells us that `ℕ` is the name of the new data, type and that it is a `Type`,
which is the way in Lean of saying that it is a type.

The keyword `where` is the name of the new datatype, and that is a `Type`,
which is the way in Lean of saying that it is a type. The keyword `where`
separates the declaration of the data from the declaration of its constructors.
Each constructor is a declared on a separate line, which is indented to
indicate that it belongs to the corresponding `data` declaration. The lines:
```
zero : ℕ
suc  : ℕ -> ℕ
```
give _signatures_ specifying the types of the constructors `zero` and `suc`.
They tell us `zero` is a natural number and that `suc` takes a natural number as
an argument and returns a natural number.

You may have noticed that `ℕ` and `→` don't appear on your keyboard. They are
symbols in _unicode_. At the end of each chapter is a list of all unicode
symbols introduced in the chapter, including instruction on how to insert them
into the editor (assuming you're using zed or intellij).

# Lean4 Natural Literal Syntax

Lean4 already defines its own inductive type for the natural numbers and also
supports integer literal syntax. We can hook into that sytax and relate it to
our own `ℕ` type with the following conversion function and typeclass instance
implementation:

```lean
def convert : _root_.Nat -> ℕ
    | _root_.Nat.zero   => .zero
    | _root_.Nat.succ n => .suc (convert n)

instance (n : _root_.Nat) : OfNat ℕ n where
    ofNat := convert n
```

# Operations on naturals are recursive functions

Now that we have the natural numbers, what can we do with them? For instance,
can we define arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication?

It turns out, each of these can be described as _recursive_ functions. Here is
the definition of addition for the `ℕ` type in lean4:

```lean
def plus : ℕ -> ℕ -> ℕ
    | .zero , n    => n
    | (.suc m) , n => .suc (plus m n)

syntax:65 (priority := high) term:66 " + " term:65 : term

macro_rules
  | `($a + $b) => `(plus $a $b)
```
The first line of `plus` gives its type: `ℕ -> ℕ -> ℕ`, which indicates that
the `plus` function accepts two naturals and returns a natural. The infix
notation allows us to write plus using the usual infix `+` notation. The
`priority := high` bit makes it more likely that uses of
`+` will get resolved to our custom `plus` function (for our own naturals
number type (`ℕ`) based on the surrounding context.

If we write zero as `0` and `suc m` as `1 + m`, the definition turns into two familiar equations:
```
 0       + n  =  n
 (1 + m) + n  =  1 + (m + n)
```
The first follows because zero is an identity for addition, and the second because addition is associative.
In its most general form, associativity is written
```
(m + n) + p = m + (n + p)
```
meaning the location of the parentheses is irrelevant.

An example of how we can use these constructors (better more illustrative
example second I think):

```lean
example : 3 + 2 = 5 :=
  calc
      3 + 2
      = .suc (2 + 2)                 := rfl
      _ = .suc (.suc (1 + 2))        := rfl
      _ = .suc (.suc (.suc (0 + 2))) := rfl
      _ = .suc (.suc (.suc 2))       := rfl
      _ = 5                          := rfl
```

Note we could've expressed the theorem like so if we wanted to
make it more clear in the local context that these literals are formed via our
`ℕ` type like so: `example : 3 + 2 = (5 : ℕ)`

Here's another version closer to the original PLFA text:

```lean
section
open ℕ  -- so we don't need dots in front of each ctor
example : 2 + 3 = 5 :=
  calc
      2 + 3
      = (suc (suc zero)) + (suc (suc (suc zero)))   := rfl
      _ = suc ((suc zero) + (suc (suc (suc zero)))) := rfl
      _ = suc (suc (zero + (suc (suc (suc zero))))) := rfl
      _ = suc (suc (suc (suc (suc zero))))          := rfl
      _ = 5                                         := rfl
end
```
